# Hyper-Hermite-Oscillator
An implementation of the Hyperbolic Tangent Waveshaping Oscillator (HTWO) using precomputed tanh tables with hermite interpolation. 
The HTWO is implemented from the formula process described by V. Lazzarini in the following paper: Lazzarini, V. & Timoney, J. "New Perspectives on Distortion Synthesis for Virtual Analog Oscillators", Computer music journal, vol. 34, no. 1, 2010, pp. 28-40.
